Hi Karthik this is my practice job

Lord Sri Venkateswara, also known as Srinivasa, Balaji, and Veṅkaṭachalapati, 
made Tirumala his abode five thousand years ago. 
Even before him, it was Lord Varahaswami who had made Tirumala his abode. 
Since then, many devotees have continued to construct grand entrances on the ramparts of the temple over generations. 
The temple complex is spread over 16.2 acres of land.
